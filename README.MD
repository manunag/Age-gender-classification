In this Python project, I utilized Deep Learning techniques to accurately determine the gender and approximate age
of individuals based on single images of their faces. The models used in this project were trained by Tal Hassner and
Gil Levi (https://talhassner.github.io/home/projects/Adience/Adience-data.html), providing robust predictions for
gender and age ranges.

The predicted gender can be categorized as either 'Male' or 'Female', while the predicted age falls within
predefined ranges: (0 – 2), (4 – 6), (8 – 12), (15 – 20), (25 – 32), (38 – 43), (48 – 53), and (60 – 100).
These age ranges were chosen due to the inherent difficulty of precisely estimating an individual's age from a
single image. Various factors such as makeup, lighting conditions, facial expressions, and occlusions make accurate
age estimation challenging. Therefore, the problem was approached as a classification task rather than regression.

By leveraging deep learning models, this project aims to provide insightful analysis and classification of facial
attributes, contributing to various applications such as demographic analysis, targeted advertising, and
personalized user experiences.
